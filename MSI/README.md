# Skeletal muscle spatial metabolomics analysis

This repository contains the collection of scripts and python notebooks used to perform the spatial metabolomics analysis presented in [C. Martinez Mir et al](). 


### Summary of the data

* 3 tomo-seq replicates of tibialis anterior muscles

All MSI datasets can be found in tthe ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD048809 [PXD048809](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/profile/reviewer_pxd048809)


### Organization of notebooks in this repository

The folder contains python notebooks used to filter and normalized the pre-processed MSI data. For the notebooks to work, input datasets are required (most of them found [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/profile/reviewer_pxd048809); otherwise please contact me). 
The main idea is to metabolites with interesting entiched patterns.
