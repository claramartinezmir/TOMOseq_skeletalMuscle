# Skeletal muscle spatial multi-omics analysis

This repository contains the collection of scripts and python notebooks used to perform the spatial transcriptomics and spatial metabolomics analysis presented in [C. Martinez Mir et al](). 

The respository is organized in two subfolders:

1. tomo-seq

Contains all python notebooks required to filter and normalize tomo-seq data. Additionally, python notebooks containing correlation between replicates and differential gene expression analysis are provided.

2. MSI

Contains all python notebooks required to filter and normalize MSI data. Additionally, code is provided for integration of MSI data with tomo-seq data.
